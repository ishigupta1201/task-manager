# This file defines environment variables for the React frontend in development.
# React apps automatically expose variables starting with REACT_APP_ to the browser.

# Base URL for your backend API.
# When running with Docker Compose, if your backend service is mapped to localhost:5000
# and your frontend is accessed from the host browser, this URL points to the host machine.
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# You can add other development-specific variables here, e.g.,
# REACT_APP_DEBUG_MODE=true
