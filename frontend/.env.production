# This file defines environment variables for the React frontend in production.
# React apps automatically expose variables starting with REACT_APP_ to the browser.

# Base URL for your backend API in a production environment.
# This should be the actual domain or IP address where your backend API is deployed.
# Example: If your backend is deployed to 'api.yourdomain.com', then the URL would be:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourproductiondomain.com/api

# For local testing of a production build, you might temporarily set it to localhost,
# but ensure this is updated for actual deployment.
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# You can add other production-specific variables here, e.g.,
# REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXXXXXX-Y
